# SDG-data
This notebook is for doing a small pre processing of Sustainable Development Goals data (set by United Nations).  
Source can be found here https://sdg-tracker.org/ and https://dashboards.sdgindex.org/downloads .

The idea was to put a few metrics together in the same csv for other folks to be able to view in the same table in an excel sheet, no frills.
